# Animal Guessing Game


This is a basic animal guessing game that works in the terminal. It can build upon itself the more times that it's played.


The game uses a binary tree and is created with one question and an animal. The game can also be loaded with a data set that includes 60 animals/questions.


After you are done playing, you can choose to save any new animals/questions learned locally in the current session. 


To play, just run main.cc in the terminal. When adding a question for a new animal, make sure to use underscores because the terminal can't understand spaces.
